# GURPS Character Creator

A play aid for creating characters for [GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/).

Note: This is a Proof of Concept project. Once I get it all working, I'll clean it up, add validation, and maybe add a UI.

## TODO
* Add notes to Disadvantage.
* Add name to Modes.

## Phase II
* Import all data files.
* Create/edit campaign files.
* Import/Export campaign files.
* Validation, validation, validation!
* Add validation messages to gameChar output.
* Add allowed advantages, disadvantages, skills, and equipment to campaign file.
* Add limits for mulitlevel advantages & disadvantages to campaign file.
